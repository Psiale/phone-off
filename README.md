# Ruby on Rails: Phone off

 Phone off is an app for you to manually track the use of your cellphone, so you can see how many time do you spend on different applications.
 You can: 
 * Create groups with images
 * Create records with and without a group relation
 * See all the records associated to a group.

 This is my capstone project for the microverse Ruby on Rails  curriculum
